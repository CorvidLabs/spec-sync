# Requirements

### REQ-change-021

The lifecycle SHALL preserve the existing canonical Change Log table schema when acceptance appends its audit row.

Acceptance Criteria

- A `Version | Date | Changes` table receives the post-bump canonical version, current date, and accepted change description in that order.
- A `Date | Author | Change` table receives the current date, `SpecSync`, and accepted change description in that order.
- Existing two-column `Date | Change` tables retain their current output.
- The appended row has the same number and order of cells as every recognized existing header.
