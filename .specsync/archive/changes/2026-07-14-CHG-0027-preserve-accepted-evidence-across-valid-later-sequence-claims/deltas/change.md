## ADDED

### REQUIREMENT REQ-change-029

Acceptance evidence SHALL preserve historical validity across valid later sequence claims without weakening current sequence-ledger integrity.

Acceptance Criteria

- Creating a later valid lifecycle record does not stale an earlier accepted record solely because the sequence ledger advanced.
- The current ledger owner's acceptance evidence binds the exact ledger content.
- Malformed claims, claims without a workspace, non-maximum claims, duplicate sequences, and invalid collision acknowledgements fail closed.
- Every covered path other than a valid later-owned sequence ledger remains acceptance-digest input.

## MODIFIED

### SPEC SECTION Contract

1. Every meaningful SDD change moves through draft, approved, implementing, verifying, accepted, and archived states without bypasses.
2. Definition and closing approvals are portable records bound to deterministic SHA-256 digests.
3. Approved semantic deltas form the effective future contract without mutating canonical specs before acceptance.
4. Requirements use stable `REQ-<module>-<number>` IDs, normative SHALL statements, and acceptance criteria.
5. Verification executes only project-configured commands without a shell and rejects direct or indirect entry into every lifecycle command surface.
6. Verification evidence is bound to the tested commit and working-tree inputs, and registry-resolved effective contracts must validate before acceptance.
7. Invalid policy, unavailable coverage comparison, failed evidence, stale ordering gates, and protected sequence-ledger edits without lifecycle coverage fail closed.
8. Concurrent deltas follow declared dependency order and canonical Markdown application preserves unrelated sections.
9. Approval validates complete module-scoped deltas, corrupt state fails closed, and archival failures remain retryable.
10. Permanent requirement tombstones come only from accepted history, and default path coverage includes root delivery metadata.
11. Concurrent effective-contract validations use isolated temporary workspaces.
12. Stale accepted delivery evidence can return only to verifying through an explicit human actor and reason, while prior verification and closing evidence remain inspectable.
13. Historical collision acknowledgements are exact immutable accepted-or-archived evidence and numeric sequence width has no four-digit upper bound.
14. A fully valid later sequence claim supersedes only the sequence-ledger bytes in historical acceptance inputs; the current owner and every other covered input remain exact evidence.
