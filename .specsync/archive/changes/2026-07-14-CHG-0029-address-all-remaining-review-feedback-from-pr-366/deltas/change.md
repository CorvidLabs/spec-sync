## ADDED

### REQUIREMENT REQ-change-030

Lifecycle enforcement SHALL preserve explicit user scope, registry authority, policy opt-out boundaries, and native verification commands while retaining fail-closed SpecSync recursion protection.

Acceptance Criteria

- Generated sequence bookkeeping does not satisfy or suppress the interview question for source, test, documentation, or configuration scope.
- Registry-resolved canonical specs and companions participate in meaningful-path coverage and acceptance hashing.
- The local registry is a protected lifecycle input because it controls canonical writes.
- An explicitly disabled SDD policy returns without sequence-ledger validation.
- Native `cargo run -- check` commands remain allowed unless Cargo is actually selecting the SpecSync binary.

## MODIFIED

### SPEC SECTION Invariants

1. Change IDs are monotonically assigned as `CHG-NNNN-slug` across active and archived workspaces.
2. No emergency or force transition bypass exists.
3. Approval digests exclude volatile lifecycle state but include every selected artifact and semantic delta.
4. Any approved definition change invalidates approval until the new digest is approved.
5. Acceptance rejects stale commits, stale contracts, incomplete tasks, failed tests, and missing requirement evidence.
6. Overlapping active semantic keys are blocked unless changes declare ordering dependencies.
7. Canonical spec versions increment and changelogs reference the accepted change ID.
8. A failed multi-file write restores all prior canonical content.
9. Change dependencies are acyclic and must be accepted or archived before dependent implementation begins.
10. Meaningful-path coverage compares the branch with the current GitHub/remote default base after a rebase, falling back to the recorded creation commit only when no remote base is available.
11. Approval digests hash repository-relative artifact paths so identical Git content validates across checkout locations and operating systems.
12. Verification command detection prefers portable project-manifest commands and uses Fledge only when no native manifest is available.
13. Persisted and hashed project paths use forward slashes on every operating system.
14. Quiet reporting executes every configured command and preserves failures while suppressing only child stdout and stderr; normal checking and verification continue streaming diagnostics.
15. Reopening current accepted evidence is rejected, and reopening stale evidence never reapplies an already canonical semantic delta.
16. Reacceptance of an already-applied change requires the definition digest captured by the latest audited reopen event; further definition changes require a new change workspace.
17. False default lifecycle fields remain absent from new persisted state, while definition validation recognizes both omitted and transitional explicit-false encodings so upgrades preserve existing approvals and verification; explicit acceptance appends stable definition evidence when the latest compatible approval uses the transitional encoding.
18. Audited reopen accepts unreachable verification commits only when canonical acceptance is recorded in current history or later recorded canonical changes govern every affected contract surface.
19. Acceptance appends a Change Log row matching the canonical table's existing column schema and uses the post-bump version when the schema includes `Version`.
20. Generated bookkeeping never replaces explicit delivery scope; registry authority, policy enablement, and native command identity are evaluated consistently before lifecycle enforcement.
