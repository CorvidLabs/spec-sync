## ADDED

### REQUIREMENT REQ-change-033

The verified lifecycle SHALL support human-authorized, append-only correction of an exact
acceptance-input canonical owner for an audited reopened, already-applied change without changing
semantic scope or replaying canonical deltas.

Acceptance Criteria

- `change correct-owner` requires an exact portable path, canonical module, non-empty actor, and
  non-empty reason.
- The target is canonical-applied, verifying through an audited reopen, and unchanged from the
  reopened definition except for validated ownership-correction entries.
- The path is already covered by the original affected paths, and the named module's current
  canonical spec explicitly owns that exact source path.
- Corrections are immutable, sequenced, definition-bound records; duplicates, removals, malformed
  values, tampering, and ambiguous ownership fail before mutation.
- Original affected specs, semantic deltas, approvals, reopen evidence, and prior verification are
  preserved byte-for-byte.
- The corrected definition requires explicit reapproval, fresh verification, and closing approval.
- Acceptance adds the corrected module only to the exact manifest entry's sorted owner set and
  never reapplies canonical deltas.
- Records without ownership corrections preserve their existing serialized bytes and digests.

## MODIFIED

### REQUIREMENT REQ-change-014

The lifecycle SHALL preserve evidence, canonical truth, project-root isolation, bootstrap usability,
and import safety through acceptance and archival.

Acceptance Criteria

- Accepted changes remain valid while every signed input is exact or every changed path/module
  obligation is governed by explicit closing-valid semantic succession evidence.
- Archive eligibility is attributable to the specific accepted change and its authenticated
  accepted snapshot rather than overlapping path coverage.
- Active and dated-archive workspaces are resolved by authenticated location-aware reads;
  duplicates and ambiguous locations fail closed.
- Archive preflights target historical integrity plus every active accepted root and dependent
  candidate before mutation, ignore unrelated authenticated archive drift, and keep immediate
  uncommitted check/status consistent.
- Trusted policy lookup and meaningful changed paths are relative to the requested project root.
- Canonical specs require lifecycle coverage and adoption covers its protected policy bootstrap.
- A no-spec declaration cannot accompany a declared public-contract change.
- OpenSpec and Spec Kit imports reject symlinked files and directories.
- Rejected foreign imports leave no partial adoption policy, report, or imported content.
- The exact schema-v1 self-adoption record is the sole migration exception to the
  no-spec/public-contract rule.
- A legacy archive baseline authority that covers the baseline ledger signs that exact ledger path
  in its acceptance manifest even though other dated archive paths remain volatile.

### SPEC SECTION Contract

1. Every meaningful SDD change moves through draft, approved, implementing, verifying, accepted, and archived states without bypasses.
2. Definition and closing approvals are portable records bound to deterministic SHA-256 digests; an explicitly requested 5.1 authority approval uses one atomically appended marked current/5.0.1-compatible definition pair whose effective full member is resolved centrally without historical approval search.
3. Approved semantic deltas form the effective future contract without mutating canonical specs before acceptance.
4. Requirements use stable `REQ-<module>-<number>` IDs, normative SHALL statements, and acceptance criteria.
5. Verification executes only project-configured commands without a shell and rejects direct or indirect entry into every lifecycle command surface.
6. Verification evidence is bound to the tested commit and working-tree inputs; descendant freshness is environment-independent and permits only internally consistent supported verification-persistence commits after inspecting every commit and parent edge.
7. Invalid policy, unavailable coverage comparison, failed evidence, stale ordering gates, and protected sequence-ledger edits without lifecycle coverage fail closed.
8. Concurrent deltas follow declared dependency order and canonical Markdown application preserves unrelated sections.
9. Approval validates complete module-scoped deltas, corrupt state fails closed, and archival failures remain retryable.
10. Permanent requirement tombstones come only from accepted history, and default path coverage includes root delivery metadata.
11. Concurrent effective-contract validations use isolated temporary workspaces.
12. Stale accepted delivery evidence can return only to verifying through an explicit human actor and reason, while prior verification and closing evidence remain inspectable.
13. Historical collision acknowledgements are exact immutable accepted-or-archived evidence and numeric sequence width has no four-digit upper bound.
14. A fully valid later sequence claim supersedes only the sequence-ledger bytes in historical acceptance inputs; the current owner and every other covered input remain exact evidence.
15. Supported accepted interview metadata changes only through a portable append-only correction ledger whose effective definition requires fresh gates and never replays canonical deltas.
16. Audited exact acceptance-owner corrections can repair omitted canonical ownership on an already-scoped input without changing semantic scope or replaying canonical deltas.

Acceptance Criteria

- Correction inspection exposes typed portable records without exposing mutable ledger internals.
- Acceptance-owner corrections expose only immutable audit fields and never mutable internal ledgers.

### SPEC SECTION Invariants

1. Change IDs are monotonically assigned as `CHG-NNNN-slug` across active and archived workspaces.
2. No emergency or force transition bypass exists.
3. Approval digests exclude volatile lifecycle state but include every selected artifact and semantic delta.
4. Any approved definition change invalidates approval until the new digest is approved.
5. Acceptance rejects stale commits, stale contracts, incomplete tasks, failed tests, and missing requirement evidence.
6. Overlapping active semantic keys are blocked unless changes declare ordering dependencies.
7. Canonical spec versions increment and changelogs reference the accepted change ID.
8. A failed multi-file write restores all prior canonical content.
9. Change dependencies are acyclic and must be accepted or archived before dependent implementation begins.
10. Meaningful-path coverage compares the branch with the current GitHub/remote default base after a rebase, falling back to the recorded creation commit only when no remote base is available.
11. Approval digests hash repository-relative artifact paths so identical Git content validates across checkout locations and operating systems.
12. Verification command detection prefers portable project-manifest commands and uses Fledge only when no native manifest is available.
13. Persisted and hashed project paths use forward slashes on every operating system.
14. Quiet reporting executes every configured command and preserves failures while suppressing only child stdout and stderr; normal checking and verification continue streaming diagnostics.
15. Reopening current accepted evidence is rejected, and reopening stale evidence never reapplies an already canonical semantic delta.
16. Reacceptance of an already-applied change requires the definition digest captured by the latest audited reopen event unless every difference is a validated additive exact-owner correction.
17. False default lifecycle fields remain absent from new persisted state, while definition validation recognizes both omitted and transitional explicit-false encodings so upgrades preserve existing approvals and verification; explicit acceptance appends stable definition evidence when the latest compatible approval uses the transitional encoding.
18. Audited reopen accepts unreachable verification commits only when canonical acceptance is recorded in current history or later recorded canonical changes govern every affected contract surface.
19. Acceptance appends a Change Log row matching the canonical table's existing column schema and uses the post-bump version when the schema includes `Version`.
20. Generated bookkeeping never replaces explicit delivery scope; registry authority, policy enablement, and native command identity are evaluated consistently before lifecycle enforcement.
21. Trusted correction-history discovery ignores unresolved remote-default references and parses Git tree paths without quoting ambiguity; regression fixtures preserve quoted-path coverage where supported while remaining valid on Windows.
22. Local and hosted verification freshness inspect every intervening commit against every parent, permit only the three supported persistence files below canonical active-change IDs, and never infer safety from a net diff or broad volatile-path exclusion.
23. Exact-owner corrections are additive, restricted to an original affected path and a current canonical source owner, and cannot mutate semantic definition fields or prior evidence.

### SPEC SECTION Error Cases

| Condition | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| Missing acceptance criteria or affected scope | Definition approval fails |
| Missing or invalid semantic delta | Approval, verification, and unified check fail |
| Verification command contains shell operators | Command is rejected without execution |
| HEAD changes after verification | Acceptance requires re-verification |
| Any intervening commit changes a disallowed path, even if later reverted | Status and strict checking require re-verification in every environment |
| Accepted delivery evidence is still current | Reopen is rejected without changing lifecycle or audit state |
| Reopen actor or reason is empty | Reopen is rejected before any mutation |
| Concurrent changes edit the same semantic key | Progress requires dependency ordering or rebase |
| Ownership correction is not exact, additive, in-scope, and canonically provable | Correction is rejected transactionally |
