### REQUIREMENT REQ-change-040

SpecSync SHALL provide a native, idempotent migration that backfills 5.1 reopening digest
fields on 5.0.1-era change ledgers with a verification pass before any write.

Acceptance Criteria

- `stale` always reproduces the embedded prior verification's acceptance-input digest.
- `current` comes from the superseding verification's signed digest, else a live recomputation.
- Records already carrying both fields are never modified; re-running is a no-op.
- A reopening that cannot be repaired deterministically fails without mutating its ledger.
- Repaired ledgers re-parse and re-validate before the write lands.
- `check` on an un-migrated ledger prints the `specsync migrate 5.0` remediation, not a raw
  serde error.

- Correction inspection exposes typed portable records without exposing mutable ledger internals.
- Acceptance-owner corrections expose only immutable audit fields and never mutable internal ledgers.


## MODIFIED

### SPEC SECTION Invariants

1. Change IDs are monotonically assigned as `CHG-NNNN-slug` across active and archived workspaces.
2. No emergency or force transition bypass exists.
3. Approval digests exclude volatile lifecycle state but include every selected artifact and semantic delta.
4. Any approved definition change invalidates approval until the new digest is approved.
5. Acceptance rejects stale commits, stale contracts, incomplete tasks, failed tests, and missing requirement evidence.
6. Overlapping active semantic keys are blocked unless changes declare ordering dependencies.
7. Canonical spec versions increment and changelogs reference the accepted change ID.
8. A failed multi-file write restores all prior canonical content.
9. Change dependencies are acyclic and must be accepted or archived before dependent implementation begins.
10. Meaningful-path coverage compares the branch with the current GitHub/remote default base after a rebase, falling back to the recorded creation commit only when no remote base is available.
11. Approval digests hash repository-relative artifact paths so identical Git content validates across checkout locations and operating systems.
12. Verification command detection prefers portable project-manifest commands and uses Fledge only when no native manifest is available.
13. Persisted and hashed project paths use forward slashes on every operating system.
14. Quiet reporting executes every configured command and preserves failures while suppressing only child stdout and stderr; normal checking and verification continue streaming diagnostics.
15. Reopening current accepted evidence is rejected, and reopening stale evidence never reapplies an already canonical semantic delta.
16. Reacceptance of an already-applied change requires the definition digest captured by the latest audited reopen event unless every difference is a validated additive exact-owner correction.
17. False default lifecycle fields remain absent from new persisted state, while definition validation recognizes both omitted and transitional explicit-false encodings so upgrades preserve existing approvals and verification; explicit acceptance appends stable definition evidence when the latest compatible approval uses the transitional encoding.
18. Audited reopen accepts unreachable verification commits only when canonical acceptance is recorded in current history or later recorded canonical changes govern every affected contract surface.
19. Acceptance appends a Change Log row matching the canonical table's existing column schema and uses the post-bump version when the schema includes `Version`.
20. Generated bookkeeping never replaces explicit delivery scope; registry authority, policy enablement, and native command identity are evaluated consistently before lifecycle enforcement.
21. Trusted correction-history discovery ignores unresolved remote-default references and parses Git tree paths without quoting ambiguity; regression fixtures preserve quoted-path coverage where supported while remaining valid on Windows.
22. Local and hosted verification freshness inspect every intervening commit against every parent, permit only the three supported persistence files below canonical active-change IDs, and never infer safety from a net diff or broad volatile-path exclusion.
23. Exact-owner corrections are additive, restricted to an original affected path and a current canonical source owner, and cannot mutate semantic definition fields or prior evidence.
24. A fully valid later accepted sequence owner covers only historical sequence-ledger drift, while the current owner and every non-ledger input remain exact.
25. A structurally valid audited delivery reopen preserves immutable sequence-collision history while fresh verification and closing approval remain mandatory.
26. Accepted-change archival trusts an in-history commit recording the change as accepted with byte-identical evidence when no first-acceptance transition anchor matches, so squash-merged evidence remains archivable while the exactly-one-eligible rule stays fail-closed.
27. Legacy acceptance-manifest reconstruction assigns the exact delivery owner to production-source inputs with no deterministic canonical owner, so adoption-era archived ledgers validate without remediation while newly signed evidence stays fail-closed.
28. The 5.0 ledger migration backfills reopening digest fields idempotently from recorded evidence only, verifies each repair before writing, and never mutates ledgers it cannot repair deterministically.
