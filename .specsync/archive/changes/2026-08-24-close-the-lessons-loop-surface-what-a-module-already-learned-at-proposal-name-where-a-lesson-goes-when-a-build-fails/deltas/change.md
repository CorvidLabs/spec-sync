**Exported Methods**

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `as_str` | Return the stable serialized name for a change state, kind, or correction field |
| `parse` | Parse user-facing change-kind, artifact, or supported correction-field names into typed values |
| `file_name` | Resolve an adaptive artifact to its safe Markdown filename |
| `is_clean` | Return true when a ledger backfill recorded no per-change failures |
| `is_degraded` | Return true when at least one workspace could not be read, so no caller may draw a conclusion from a missing record |

Acceptance Criteria

- Nested lifecycle commands still fail once with the established deterministic contextual error.
- The process marker and diagnostic helper remain private binary implementation details.
- Correction inspection exposes typed portable records without exposing mutable ledger internals.
- Acceptance-owner corrections expose only immutable audit fields and never mutable internal ledgers.

### SPEC SECTION Invariants

1. Change IDs are monotonically assigned as `CHG-NNNN-slug` across active and archived workspaces.
2. No emergency or force transition bypass exists.
3. Approval digests exclude volatile lifecycle state but include every selected artifact and semantic delta.
4. Any addition, removal, or replacement in approved stable scope invalidates approval until the new digest is approved.
5. Finalization rejects stale commits, contracts, reviews, incomplete tasks, failed tests, and missing requirement evidence.
6. Overlapping active semantic keys are blocked unless changes declare ordering dependencies.
7. Canonical spec versions increment and changelogs reference the accepted change ID.
8. A failed multi-file write restores all prior canonical content.
9. Change dependencies are acyclic and must be accepted or archived before dependent implementation begins.
10. Meaningful-path coverage compares the branch with the current GitHub/remote default base after a rebase, falling back to the recorded creation commit only when no remote base is available.
11. Approval digests hash repository-relative artifact paths so identical Git content validates across checkout locations and operating systems.
12. Verification command detection prefers portable project-manifest commands and uses Fledge only when no native manifest is available.
13. Persisted and hashed project paths use forward slashes on every operating system.
14. Quiet reporting executes every configured command and preserves failures while suppressing only child stdout and stderr; normal checking and verification continue streaming diagnostics.
15. Reopening accepted evidence is rejected only when its delivery inputs are current AND its verification commit is still anchored in current history; reopening stale evidence never reapplies an already canonical semantic delta.
16. Reacceptance of an already-applied change requires the definition digest captured by the latest audited reopen event unless every difference is a validated additive exact-owner correction.
17. False default lifecycle fields remain absent from new persisted state, while definition validation recognizes both omitted and transitional explicit-false encodings so upgrades preserve existing approvals and verification; explicit acceptance appends stable definition evidence when the latest compatible approval uses the transitional encoding.
18. An unreachable verification commit is itself an admissible staleness axis for audited reopen, recorded as an explicit cause in the reopen ledger; every other authentication check stays fatal, and reacceptance still requires canonical acceptance or deterministic semantic succession provable from trusted history.
19. Acceptance appends a Change Log row matching the canonical table's existing column schema and uses the post-bump version when the schema includes `Version`.
20. Generated bookkeeping never replaces explicit delivery scope; registry authority, policy enablement, and native command identity are evaluated consistently before lifecycle enforcement.
21. Trusted correction-history discovery ignores unresolved remote-default references and parses Git tree paths without quoting ambiguity; regression fixtures preserve quoted-path coverage where supported while remaining valid on Windows.
22. Local and hosted verification freshness inspect every intervening commit against every parent, permit only `state.json`, `verification.json`, `verification-attempts.json`, `review.json`, and `review-attempts.json` below canonical active-change IDs, and never infer safety from a net diff or broad volatile-path exclusion.
23. Exact-owner corrections are additive, restricted to an original affected path and a current canonical source owner, and cannot mutate semantic definition fields or prior evidence.
24. A fully valid later accepted sequence owner covers only historical sequence-ledger drift; reconstruction reuses exact committed collision-owner ledger bytes when available, while the current owner and every non-ledger input remain exact.
25. A structurally valid audited delivery reopen preserves immutable sequence-collision history while fresh verification and closing approval remain mandatory.
26. Accepted-change archival trusts an in-history commit recording the change as accepted with byte-identical evidence when no first-acceptance transition anchor matches, so squash-merged evidence remains archivable while the exactly-one-eligible rule stays fail-closed.
27. Legacy acceptance-manifest reconstruction assigns the exact delivery owner to production-source inputs with no deterministic canonical owner, so adoption-era archived ledgers validate without remediation while newly signed evidence stays fail-closed.
28. Batch exact-owner correction validates every proposed path/module pair independently and fails closed with zero persisted mutations when any entry is invalid.
29. The 5.0 ledger migration backfills reopening digest fields idempotently from recorded evidence only, verifies each repair before writing, and never mutates ledgers it cannot repair deterministically.
30. Canonical module path resolution treats missing and inert local registries as absent fallbacks while non-inert unparsable registries still fail closed with the established parse diagnostic.
31. Immutable workflow-origin validation follows every bounded reachable canonical dated archive path for the exact change ID, preserving identity across archive, reopen, and cross-date rearchive moves.
32. The workflow-v2 baseline retains its exact introduction bytes at every bounded touching commit and readable parent, rejecting rewrite-then-restore history.
33. Answer, dependency, and supersession mutations load and validate correction history only after acquiring the lifecycle project lock.
34. `finalize_change` assembles `lesson-bundle.md` into the archive on a best-effort basis: a bundle failure never undoes a completed archival, and the material is read entirely from disk so finalize keeps working offline and in CI. SpecSync assembles and never authors the lessons; the agent that ran `finalize` writes them, guided by `next_action`.
35. Frontmatter is stripped at its closing delimiter, never at the next `---` in the document, so an artifact containing a Markdown horizontal rule is never silently truncated to a fragment.

### SPEC SECTION Behavioral Examples

**Scenario: Archival compounds knowledge into the spec**

- **Given** a change is finalized
- **When** `finalize_change` archives it
- **Then** the archive contains `lesson-bundle.md` naming the change, its specs, its paths, and the material to fold
- **And** an unwritable bundle leaves the archive intact and the finalize successful

**Scenario: Verified feature delivery**

- **Given** an approved feature with `REQ-auth-001`, completed artifacts, and configured targeted tests
- **When** implementation verifies, receives its scoped PR review, and runs `change finalize`
- **Then** canonical requirements/specs update and the package moves to the dated archive in the same PR, ready for GitHub merge

**Scenario: Approved intent changes**

- **Given** a valid definition approval
- **When** a selected design, requirement, or delta is edited
- **Then** progress is blocked until the new digest is approved

**Scenario: Feature branch rebases onto upstream**

- **Given** a change workspace created before new commits landed on the remote default branch
- **When** the feature branch rebases and unified checking computes meaningful changed paths
- **Then** upstream-only paths are excluded and only the feature branch diff requires change coverage

**Scenario: Review fixes stale accepted evidence**

- **Given** an accepted change whose governed delivery inputs changed after closing approval
- **When** a human reopens it with an actor and reason
- **Then** the prior verification and closing approval remain in audit history, strict checking stays red until fresh verification, and reacceptance records a new closing approval without reapplying canonical deltas

**Scenario: Persisted verification evidence**

- **Given** a supported verification run passed on the current commit
- **When** one or more descendant commits persist only its canonical state, verification, and attempt-ledger files
- **Then** local status, local strict checking, and hosted checking all keep the evidence current while matching contract and project-input digests remain mandatory

**Scenario: Inert registry stub falls back to conventional paths**

- **Given** a project with an inert 5.0.1-era `.specsync/registry.toml` stub and a conventional `specs/auth/auth.spec.md`
- **When** semantic preparation resolves module `auth`
- **Then** resolution succeeds via the conventional path without requiring a registry name

**Scenario: Overlapping Git candidate batches repeat an index entry**

- **Given** a delivery scope containing a tracked parent directory and enough exact tracked children to cross the pathspec batch boundary
- **When** Git returns one child through both the parent pathspec and its later exact pathspec
- **Then** identical mode/object pairs are represented once, while either a mode or object mismatch fails closed

**Scenario: Correction history changes while a mutation waits**

- **Given** an existing-change mutation blocked on the lifecycle project lock
- **When** the correction ledger becomes invalid before that mutation acquires the lock
- **Then** the mutation reloads and validates the ledger under lock, fails safely, and persists no lifecycle update
