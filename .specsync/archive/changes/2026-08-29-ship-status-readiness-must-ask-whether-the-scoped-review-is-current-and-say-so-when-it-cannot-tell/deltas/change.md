### REQUIREMENT REQ-change-046

Agent-authored changes SHALL receive one independent scoped review of implementation evidence before
finalization.

Acceptance Criteria

- Review input contains only the change package, implementation diff, canonical semantic delta, and
  targeted evidence.
- The result binds the implementation parent commit, those input digests, an explicit pass/block
  verdict, a stable reviewer claim distinct from the scope approver, and the exact required
  GitHub Actions check whose authenticated result is proven again by finalization.
- Every review attempt is append-only; `review.json` is only the latest projection and cannot erase
  a prior blocking result.
- Native review recording and finalization run the same every-parent verification-freshness
  validator as project checking, and every persisted review attempt revalidates that its reviewer
  is distinct from the scope approver bound to that attempt's contract digest.
- Every intervening commit is inspected against every parent; any implementation change, including
  change-then-revert history, stales the review, while the metadata/archive-only finalization commit
  does not rerun or stale it. Native and hosted validators load the same committed descendant,
  parent, output, and timeout limits.
- Scoped-review currency is a three-valued answer, not a predicate. It is `current` when every
  recorded binding still agrees with the tree; `stale` when a bound digest moved or the descendant
  walk ran and inspected a commit that changed a path outside this change's own lifecycle records;
  and `unavailable` when the walk could not run at all — most often because a squash, rebase, amend,
  or force-push rewrote the reviewed commit, leaving `implementation_commit..HEAD` with no range to
  walk. A caller that reports an unavailable answer as a satisfied one is wrong in the direction
  that costs the most, and one that reports it as a violation asserts a guarantee it never evaluated.
- Content is decided before history: a review whose recorded contract, execution, or workspace digest
  no longer matches the tree is `stale` for that reason, and the descendant walk's own availability
  is consulted only once the content agrees.
- Finalization fails when a required scoped review is missing or blocking.
- Status states when review is needed and directs the user to open or update the PR so the configured
  scoped-review check runs.

**Exported Methods**

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `as_str` | Return the stable serialized name for a change state, kind, or correction field |
| `parse` | Parse user-facing change-kind, artifact, or supported correction-field names into typed values |
| `file_name` | Resolve an adaptive artifact to its safe Markdown filename |

Acceptance Criteria

- Nested lifecycle commands still fail once with the established deterministic contextual error.
- The process marker and diagnostic helper remain private binary implementation details.
- Correction inspection exposes typed portable records without exposing mutable ledger internals.
- Acceptance-owner corrections expose only immutable audit fields and never mutable internal ledgers.
