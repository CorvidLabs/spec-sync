## MODIFIED

### REQUIREMENT REQ-change-017
The lifecycle SHALL provide an audited recovery transition when accepted verification becomes stale because governed delivery inputs changed.

Acceptance Criteria
- Reopen requires an explicit non-empty human actor and reason and rejects non-stale accepted evidence.
- Reopen moves accepted evidence to verifying so strict checks remain red until a fresh verification run succeeds.
- Prior definition approval, verification, and closing approval evidence remain inspectable in append-only audit history.
- Reacceptance requires a new closing approval and does not reapply canonical deltas already accepted.
- Reacceptance rejects a definition digest that differs from the latest pre-reopen verification contract and directs further spec work to a new change workspace.
- A verifying already-applied change without audited reopen history fails closed.

### SPEC SECTION Invariants
1. Change IDs are monotonically assigned as `CHG-NNNN-slug` across active and archived workspaces.
2. No emergency or force transition bypass exists.
3. Approval digests exclude volatile lifecycle state but include every selected artifact and semantic delta.
4. Any approved definition change invalidates approval until the new digest is approved.
5. Acceptance rejects stale commits, stale contracts, incomplete tasks, failed tests, and missing requirement evidence.
6. Overlapping active semantic keys are blocked unless changes declare ordering dependencies.
7. Canonical spec versions increment and changelogs reference the accepted change ID.
8. A failed multi-file write restores all prior canonical content.
9. Change dependencies are acyclic and must be accepted or archived before dependent implementation begins.
10. Meaningful-path coverage compares the branch with the current GitHub/remote default base after a rebase, falling back to the recorded creation commit only when no remote base is available.
11. Approval digests hash repository-relative artifact paths so identical Git content validates across checkout locations and operating systems.
12. Verification command detection prefers portable project-manifest commands and uses Fledge only when no native manifest is available.
13. Persisted and hashed project paths use forward slashes on every operating system.
14. Quiet reporting executes every configured command and preserves failures while suppressing only child stdout and stderr; normal checking and verification continue streaming diagnostics.
15. Reopening current accepted evidence is rejected, and reopening stale evidence never reapplies an already canonical semantic delta.
16. Reacceptance of an already-applied change requires the definition digest captured by the latest audited reopen event; further definition changes require a new change workspace.
