## ADDED

### REQUIREMENT REQ-change-026

The lifecycle SHALL treat sequence claims and historical collision acknowledgements as protected exact repository evidence across arbitrarily wide numeric sequences.

Acceptance Criteria

- Numeric change sequences contain at least four ASCII digits and support values beyond 9999.
- The committed sequence ledger always requires lifecycle coverage even when `.specsync/` is ignored.
- An acknowledgement matches the exact currently located ID set and remains valid only when every member is accepted or archived.
- Removed IDs, added IDs, single surviving records, and draft, approved, implementing, or verifying collision members fail closed.

### REQUIREMENT REQ-change-027

Configured verification SHALL reject direct and indirect entry into every SpecSync lifecycle command surface.

Acceptance Criteria

- Nested `check`, `change`, and `lifecycle` commands fail before performing validation or mutation.
- Native verification commands remain unaffected and execute once.
- The diagnostic names the configured parent command.

### REQUIREMENT REQ-change-028

Effective contract and canonical-successor validation SHALL use canonical repository resolution without redundant full-project hashing.

Acceptance Criteria

- Effective validation reads registry-backed canonical specs through the safe project-path resolver.
- Conventional canonical paths remain the fallback when no registry mapping exists.
- Unsafe registry mappings fail closed before effective validation.
- The current project digest is computed at most once per canonical-successor candidate scan.

## MODIFIED

### SPEC SECTION Contract

1. Every meaningful SDD change moves through draft, approved, implementing, verifying, accepted, and archived states without bypasses.
2. Definition and closing approvals are portable records bound to deterministic SHA-256 digests.
3. Approved semantic deltas form the effective future contract without mutating canonical specs before acceptance.
4. Requirements use stable `REQ-<module>-<number>` IDs, normative SHALL statements, and acceptance criteria.
5. Verification executes only project-configured commands without a shell and rejects direct or indirect entry into every lifecycle command surface.
6. Verification evidence is bound to the tested commit and working-tree inputs, and registry-resolved effective contracts must validate before acceptance.
7. Invalid policy, unavailable coverage comparison, failed evidence, stale ordering gates, and protected sequence-ledger edits without lifecycle coverage fail closed.
8. Concurrent deltas follow declared dependency order and canonical Markdown application preserves unrelated sections.
9. Approval validates complete module-scoped deltas, corrupt state fails closed, and archival failures remain retryable.
10. Permanent requirement tombstones come only from accepted history, and default path coverage includes root delivery metadata.
11. Concurrent effective-contract validations use isolated temporary workspaces.
12. Stale accepted delivery evidence can return only to verifying through an explicit human actor and reason, while prior verification and closing evidence remain inspectable.
13. Historical collision acknowledgements are exact immutable accepted-or-archived evidence and numeric sequence width has no four-digit upper bound.
