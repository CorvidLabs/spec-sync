## ADDED

### REQUIREMENT REQ-cmd-change-005

The change command adapter SHALL guide every user through the single one-approval workflow and
same-PR finalization without performing an external merge.

Acceptance Criteria

- `status` always prints exactly one explicit next action.
- When scope approval is missing or stale, status prints the exact current digest next to that
  approval action.
- Status requests renewed approval only for a material stable-scope expansion and lists each added
  criterion, affected spec/path, dependency, supersession obligation, or changed intent in plain
  language; execution/evidence-only changes direct the user to `change check` instead.
- Newcomer output teaches `new → approve → implement → check → review → finalize → GitHub merge`.
- Agent-authored status identifies a missing scoped review and explains that opening or updating the
  PR requests the configured review check.
- Status names any strict validators required by `--strict`, project policy, or release/security
  classification without presenting a different lifecycle.
- `finalize` reports the implementation parent, archived path, finalization digest, and readiness
  for GitHub merge; it never claims to merge or invokes a provider merge API.
- JSON and text expose the same current gate and next action.
