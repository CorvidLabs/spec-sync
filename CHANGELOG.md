## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added

- **Complete rewrite from TypeScript to Rust** for language-agnostic spec validation
  with significantly improved performance and a single static binary.
- **9 language backends** for export extraction: TypeScript/JavaScript, Rust, Go,
  Python, Swift, Kotlin, Java, C#, and Dart.
- **`check` command** — validates all spec files against source code, checking
  frontmatter, file existence, required sections, API surface coverage,
  DB table references, and dependency specs.
- **`coverage` command** — reports file and module coverage, listing unspecced
  files and modules.
- **`generate` command** — scaffolds spec files for unspecced modules using
  a customizable template (`_template.spec.md`).
- **`init` command** — creates a default `specsync.json` configuration file.
- **`--json` flag** — global CLI flag that outputs results as structured JSON
  instead of colored terminal text, for CI/CD and tooling integration.
- **`--strict` flag** — treats warnings as errors for CI enforcement.
- **`--require-coverage N` flag** — fails if file coverage percent is below
  the given threshold.
- **`--root` flag** — overrides the project root directory.
- **CI/CD workflows** with GitHub Actions for testing, linting, and
  multi-platform release binary publishing (Linux x86_64/aarch64,
  macOS x86_64/aarch64, Windows x86_64).
- Configurable required sections, exclude patterns, source extensions,
  and schema table validation via `specsync.json`.
- YAML frontmatter parsing without external YAML dependencies.
- API surface validation: detects undocumented exports (warnings) and
  phantom documentation for non-existent exports (errors).
- Dependency spec cross-referencing and Consumed By section validation.
