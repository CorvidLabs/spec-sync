# Context

Canonical module maturity remains under `specsync lifecycle`; SDD delivery uses six separate states. `.specsync/sdd.json` is a dedicated versioned policy so existing projects remain opt-in. Human artifacts and deltas are Markdown, while state, approvals, and evidence are JSON. Verification commands come only from policy and run without a shell.

The public lifecycle remains one module for 5.0 to avoid a late high-risk refactor. Its intended internal seams are state/transitions, approvals/evidence, semantic deltas, Git/path coverage, effective-contract validation, and adoption/import. Extract those seams after 5.0 without changing the public API. Release evidence is recorded in accepted/archived change workspaces and the PR matrix rather than frozen as a permanent claim here.

`check_project_quiet` shares all fail-closed validation with `check_project` but discards configured child-command output so `specsync comment` can emit a single bounded markdown protocol. Explicit verification and ordinary checks retain streamed diagnostics.
