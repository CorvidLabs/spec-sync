# Requirements

### REQ-change-001

The system SHALL require definition and closing human approval gates for every meaningful change.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- Neither gate exposes a force or emergency bypass.
- Artifact changes invalidate the definition approval digest.

### REQ-change-002

The system SHALL validate implementation against canonical contracts plus approved active semantic deltas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- Canonical files remain unchanged before acceptance.
- Overlapping active deltas are detected before implementation.

### REQ-change-003

The system SHALL connect durable requirement IDs to technical specs, tests, and verification evidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- New or modified requirements use SHALL statements and acceptance criteria.
- Acceptance fails when spec-changing work has no requirement evidence.

### REQ-change-004

The system SHALL support equivalent human CLI and structured agent workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- Every change operation has machine-readable JSON output.
- The same deterministic interview drives terminal and agent integrations.

### REQ-change-005

The system SHALL preserve unrelated canonical Markdown when applying semantic blocks.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- Modifying or removing the final requirement before a higher-level heading preserves that heading and all following content.
- Failed preparation leaves canonical files byte-for-byte unchanged.
- An interrupted multi-file acceptance is recovered from its transaction journal before the next lifecycle mutation.

### REQ-change-006

The system SHALL bind verification evidence to every tested working-tree input.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- Source, test, configuration, or contract edits after verification invalidate acceptance even when HEAD is unchanged.
- Failed verification remains an error until fresh successful evidence is recorded.

### REQ-change-007

The system SHALL fail closed when lifecycle enforcement cannot be evaluated.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- Malformed policy and unavailable changed-path comparison fail unified checking.
- A successful changed-path comparison with no output is valid empty coverage evidence.
- Effective-contract validation runs during verification and acceptance.
- Oversized lifecycle artifacts and unsafe, traversing, or symlink-escaping project paths are rejected.

### REQ-change-008

The system SHALL apply concurrent change semantics in declared dependency order.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- Effective deltas are topologically ordered regardless of change ID.
- Dependency and conflict gates are rechecked immediately before acceptance.
- Path coverage matches complete path components rather than arbitrary prefixes.
- Lifecycle mutations serialize through an operating-system lock so concurrent creation cannot duplicate IDs.

### REQ-change-009

The system SHALL keep definitions and persisted lifecycle state trustworthy through approval, adoption, and archival.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- Definition approval rejects missing, malformed, or cross-module semantic requirements before recording evidence.
- Corrupt active state fails unified checking instead of disappearing from enforcement.
- Failed archive moves preserve the accepted active workspace so archival can be retried.
- Only accepted or archived requirement removals become permanent tombstones.
- Spec Kit adoption does not classify native companion-only spec directories as feature workspaces.

### REQ-change-010

The system SHALL require lifecycle coverage for common root action, manifest, and dependency lock files by default.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- Root Action configuration and supported ecosystem manifest or lockfile changes are meaningful paths.
- Component-boundary matching continues to exclude similarly prefixed unrelated files.

### REQ-change-011

The system SHALL isolate temporary effective-contract state across concurrent validations.

Acceptance Criteria
- Parallel validations in one process allocate distinct scratch paths.
- Each validation removes only its own scratch workspace.

### REQ-change-012

The lifecycle SHALL fail closed across coverage, persisted closing evidence, semantic-delta validation, dependency ordering, and supported canonical version formats.

Acceptance Criteria
- Only implementing, verifying, or accepted changes cover meaningful delivery paths.
- Local coverage includes committed, staged, unstaged, and untracked meaningful paths.
- Accepted workspaces require fresh successful verification and matching closing approval evidence.
- Delta modules, operation headings, tombstones at acceptance, and transitive dependency order are validated deterministically.
- Integer and semantic spec versions advance without losing their format.

### REQ-change-013

The lifecycle SHALL reject untrusted or corrupt persisted workspace identity, scope, approval, history, and verification evidence before using it.

Acceptance Criteria
- Loaded change IDs match their requested workspace and remain a single validated component.
- Persisted affected spec names are validated before delta paths are constructed.
- Unreadable or malformed historical tombstone deltas and approval ledgers fail closed.
- Verifying workspaces require passed, fresh verification evidence in CI and local checks.

### REQ-change-014

The lifecycle SHALL preserve evidence, canonical truth, project-root isolation, bootstrap usability, and import safety through acceptance and archival.

Acceptance Criteria
- Accepted changes remain valid only while verification matches current delivery inputs, and archive revalidates the same evidence.
- Archive eligibility is attributable to the specific accepted change rather than overlapping path coverage from another change.
- Trusted policy lookup and meaningful changed paths are relative to the requested project root.
- Canonical specs require lifecycle coverage and adoption covers its protected policy bootstrap.
- A no-spec declaration cannot accompany a declared public-contract change.
- OpenSpec and Spec Kit imports reject symlinked files and directories.
- Rejected foreign imports leave no partial adoption policy, report, or imported content.
- The exact schema-v1 self-adoption record is the sole migration exception to the no-spec/public-contract rule.

### REQ-change-015

Unified lifecycle checking SHALL support a protocol-clean reporting mode without weakening verification.

Acceptance Criteria
- Reporting mode still executes every configured verification command and records failures.
- Reporting mode suppresses child command stdout and stderr so the caller can emit one machine-consumable document.
- Normal check and explicit change verification retain their diagnostic output.

### REQ-change-016

The lifecycle SHALL preserve accepted closing evidence across repository-integrated squash merges without accepting
unintegrated or altered evidence.

Acceptance Criteria
- Normal verification-commit ancestry remains the primary proof.
- A squash fallback requires matching scoped inputs and an unchanged accepted workspace already integrated on the
  remote default branch.
- Unintegrated heads, changed scoped inputs, stale contracts, and mismatched closing approvals fail closed.
- Squash-integrated accepted workspaces remain archivable.
- Digest fields are versioned, domain-separated, and length-framed so file boundaries cannot be forged with embedded
  NUL bytes.
- Binary bytes remain exact, while stable file kind and executable-mode evidence invalidate relevant delivery changes.
- Cross-platform topology verification is independent of a runner's global line-ending checkout policy.

### REQ-change-017

The lifecycle SHALL provide an audited recovery transition when accepted verification becomes stale because governed delivery inputs changed.

Acceptance Criteria
- Reopen requires an explicit non-empty human actor and reason and rejects non-stale accepted evidence.
- Reopen moves accepted evidence to verifying so strict checks remain red until a fresh verification run succeeds.
- Prior definition approval, verification, and closing approval evidence remain inspectable in append-only audit history.
- Reacceptance requires a new closing approval and does not reapply canonical deltas already accepted.
- Reacceptance rejects a definition digest that differs from the latest pre-reopen verification contract and directs further spec work to a new change workspace.
- A verifying already-applied change without audited reopen history fails closed.

### REQ-change-018

Audited reopening SHALL recognize canonical acceptance recorded in current Git history after squash integration or complete later canonical governance.

Acceptance Criteria

- Definition digest, passed evidence, closing approval, stale delivery inputs, actor, and reason remain mandatory.
- An unreachable verification commit is allowed only when current history records acceptance or later recorded canonical changes govern every affected spec and path.
- Arbitrary off-history evidence remains rejected.

### REQ-change-019

Verification SHALL recognize a non-removed requirement or spec-section delta item as semantic acceptance evidence when observable acceptance criteria are present.

Acceptance Criteria

- A section-only modified delta can pass with an empty requirement-ID list.
- Requirement evidence mapping remains mandatory for every collected requirement ID.
- A failed configured command, missing semantic acceptance evidence, and missing requirement evidence produce distinct diagnostics.

### REQ-change-020

Audited reacceptance SHALL preserve compatible legacy definition evidence while enforcing immutable reopened definitions, fresh evidence, semantic successor governance, and validation of every current canonical contract it reapproves.

Acceptance Criteria
- A prior verification digest using the transitional explicit-false lifecycle encoding remains compatible with the stable omitted-false encoding during reopened reacceptance.
- An accepted no-spec change cannot satisfy the canonical-successor fallback, even when its affected paths and specs overlap.
- A later recorded semantic canonical change can satisfy successor governance for every overlapping affected spec and path.
- A reopened canonical-applied change validates its current canonical modules without replaying its already-applied semantic delta.
- Strict project checks reject a reopened definition that reacceptance would reject.
- Definition reapproval keeps a canonical-applied reopened record in the verifying state so fresh evidence remains mandatory.
- Nested project history lookup anchors repository-relative workspace state paths at the Git repository top.
- Reopen rejects a request when current delivery inputs match accepted evidence, regardless of another closing-validity failure.

### REQ-change-021

The lifecycle SHALL preserve the existing canonical Change Log table schema when acceptance appends its audit row.

Acceptance Criteria

- A `Version | Date | Changes` table receives the post-bump canonical version, current date, and accepted change description in that order.
- A `Date | Author | Change` table receives the current date, `SpecSync`, and accepted change description in that order.
- Existing two-column `Date | Change` tables retain their current output.
- The appended row has the same number and order of cells as every recognized existing header.
