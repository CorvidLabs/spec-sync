# Testing

CLI integration coverage validates creation, JSON schema, rationale errors, adoption dry runs, initialization, and the complete stale accepted → reopen → verify → reaccept flow. Reopen assertions cover deterministic audit JSON and preserved approval/reopen ledger history. Domain transitions are covered by change-module unit tests.

`REQ-cmd-change-002` is covered by the accepted → correct → approve → verify → reaccept CLI integration flow. It asserts equivalent text and JSON original/effective projections, correction history, added-artifact next actions, and persisted append-only evidence.
