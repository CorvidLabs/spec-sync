## User Stories

- As a validator author, I want a shared edit-distance helper so near-miss source/spec references can produce useful suggestions without duplicating string comparison logic.
- As a rule/config author, I want user-provided regex patterns compiled with bounded resources so invalid or pathological patterns cannot crash validation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `levenshtein` returns character-based edit distance for UTF-8 strings, including empty-string inputs.
- `safe_regex` returns a compiled regex for valid patterns within configured size limits.
- `safe_regex` returns `None` for invalid syntax or patterns that exceed regex/DFA size limits.
- Utility helpers remain dependency-light and do not read project configuration or filesystem state.

## Constraints

- Regex compilation must use explicit size and DFA limits to reduce ReDoS risk from configuration-supplied patterns.
- Helpers must be deterministic and side-effect free so they are safe to call from validation, parsing, and suggestion code.

## Out of Scope

- High-level validation policy decisions belong in validator, parser, or command modules.
- Regex matching semantics beyond safe compilation are handled by callers.

### REQ-util-001

Shared utility helpers SHALL provide deterministic edit distance and resource-bounded regular-expression compilation without side effects.

Acceptance Criteria
- `levenshtein` returns character-based edit distance for UTF-8 strings, including empty-string inputs.
- `safe_regex` returns a compiled regex for valid patterns within configured size limits.
- `safe_regex` returns `None` for invalid syntax or patterns that exceed regex/DFA size limits.
- Utility helpers remain dependency-light and do not read project configuration or filesystem state.
